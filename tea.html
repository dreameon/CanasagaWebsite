			<h1>
				You are what you eat
			</h1>
			<p> We all should eat 
				healthier, but the abundance of 
				delicious foods makes it difficult 
				to do so. Fortunately, drinking 
				healthy tea is an easy way to 
				achieve a healthy and balanced diet, 
				and to prevent or fight illnesses. 
				Various teas can be matched with 
				different foods; just like wine, 
				there are teas better suited for red 
				meats, seafood, or dessert. Tea can 
				also simply be a refreshment. Our 
				tea allows you to absorb many 
				healthy ingredients in a natural 
				way.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<h1>Natural and Healthy
			</h1>
			<p>Teas are like herbs, 
				they bring 
				beneficial effects to our health. To treat a sore 
				throat, we may take the monk fruit tea. To soothe tired 
				and strained eyes, we may take the goji berry tea. These teas, being 
				composed of a single ingredient, 
				are all simple. However, Chinese herbalists and 
				noticed that their recipes elevate 
				and further the health benefits of 
				tea. Together with the medical 
				research conducted in different 
				universities, it has been proven 
				that certain tea, herbs, fruits, and 
				flowers can bring huge benefits to 
				our health. All Canasaga teas are all 
				natural and without any artificial 
				additive. Many of them are either 
				wild grown or organic 
				too.</p>
